      <p>You can be the next owner of the gem! The current price is
        <span class="price"></span>. After your purchase, the gem's price will be
        <span id="new_price"></span> bits.</p>
      <p>You will stay the owner until the next person buys it. We then will send
        <span class="payout"></span> bits back to you.
        <b>Yes, that's a 25% profit for you.</b>
      </p>
      <p>However, there's a
        <strong>1 in 32</strong> (3.125%) chance that the gem will reset each time it is purchased. It will also reset if there's
        no new buyer for 24 hours. Should your purchase result in a reset, you will lose your stake and the gem's price will
        start over at 1 bit.

      <h4>FAQ</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <h5>What is this all about?</h5>
      <p>The Lightning Gem is a fun game as well as an exercise in psychology. You can think of it as a series of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania"
          target="_blank">speculative bubbles</a>.</p>
      <h5>What is the lightning network?</h5>
      <p>The
        <a href="https://lightning.network/">lightning network</a> is a second layer payment network on top of bitcoin that enables microtransactions and instant
        settlement. This site uses
        <a href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd">lnd</a> for lightning functionality.</p>
      <h5>Why should I buy the gem?</h5>
      <p>To advertise your name (or link) under it and show off that you own the gem. Not to mention you can make a handsome
        profit when a new buyer comes in!</p>
      <h5>How do I create an invoice with an expiry of at least 24h hours?</h5>
      <p>Using the command line interface with lnd, you can create a long-lived invoice by setting the
        <code>expiry</code> parameter to a value over 86400. For example, to create an invoice for 1.25 bits that's good for a day use
        <code>lncli addinvoice --amt 125 --expiry 86400</code>.</p>
      <h5>Why can't I complete my payment to buy the gem?</h5>
      <p>Your node may be unable to find a payment path to ours. You can open a channel with us directly at
        <code name="lnd_connection_string"></code>.</p>
      <h5>How does the price increase?</h5>
      <p>Every time the gem changes owners its worth increases by 30% rounded to the nearest satoshi.</p>
      <h5>How do random resets work?</h5>
      <p>We take the payment request you generated and append a secret string of characters as a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce">nonce</a>, then we hash that using SHA-256. We convert the first byte of the hash to a number from 0 to 255. If that
        number is less than 8 - which will happen 1 in 32 times - we reset the gem. We use a different secret every day based
        on UTC time, and every day we will publish the secret for the previous day
        <a href="secrets.txt">here</a> so you can check our work for yourself. A list of the SHA-256 hashes for all secrets we will use through
        2018 is available as a gist
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/sangaman/00ec664d22548c7f2517a79d3fd31bf4">here</a>.</p>
      <h5>What happens if no one after me buys the gem?</h5>
      <p>If there's no new buyer for more than 24 hours, the gem will reset automatically to 1 bit and you'll lose your stake.</p>
      <h5>What's a bit?</h5>
      <p>A bit, as specified in
        <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0176.mediawiki">BIP176</a>, is 1 millionth of a bitcoin - or 100 satoshis.</p>
      <h5>What happens if I send payment but someone buys the gem before me?</h5>
      <p>The website will automatically indicate if someone else buys the gem after you have submitted a request to buy the
        gem, so if you check this page before submitting your payment you can prevent this from happening. If you pay a stale invoice by mistake
        anyway,
        <a href="mailto:bitcoingem@gmail.com">e-mail us</a> for a refund.</p>
      <h5>Someone bought the gem from me, but I didn't get paid!</h5>
      <p>We probably weren't able to pay your invoice - either your lightning node went offline, or we couldn't find a path to
        you, or a path exists but there's not enough balance in any of your active channels to cover your payout.
        <a href="mailto:bitcoingem@gmail.com">E-mail us</a> if this happens and we'll pay you manually. <em>Note:</em> you can check if our node is
        able to pay you by checking our <a href="https://info.lightninggem.com">info page</a> and seeing if <code>QuerySwapRoutes</code> finds a route
        for your payout.</p>
      <h5>I bought the gem but changed my mind, can you refund me?</h5>
      <p>Once you are the owner of the gem, we can't refund you because the previous owner already will already have been paid.</p>
      <h5>Who are you, and why should I trust you?</h5>
      <p>This site is created and operated by
        <a href="https://twitter.com/sangaman">Daniel McNally</a>. It is a remake and continuation of the original
        <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=138749.0">Bitcoin Gem</a>. We weren't the creators of the Bitcoin Gem, but we were its second and most recent owners and operated
        it honestly until it was eventually shut down due to lack of interest.</p>
